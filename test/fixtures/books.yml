  about: "At last, Ayn Rand's masterpiece is available to her millions of loyal readers
    in trade paperback.\r\nWith this acclaimed work and its immortal query, \"Who
    is John Galt?\", Ayn Rand found the perfect artistic form to express her vision
    of existence. Atlas Shrugged made Rand not only one of the most popular novelists
    of the century, but one of its most influential thinkers.\r\nAtlas Shrugged is
    the astounding story of a man who said that he would stop the motor of the world--and
    did. Tremendous in scope, breathtaking in its suspense, Atlas Shrugged stretches
    the boundaries further than any book you have ever read. It is a mystery, not
    about the murder of a man's body, but about the murder--and rebirth--of man's
    spirit.\r\nAtlas Shrugged is the \"second most influential book for Americans
    today\" after the Bible, according to a joint survey conducted by the Library
    of Congress and the Book of the Month Club. [amazon.com]"

  title: 'Democracy: The God That Failed'

  about: "The core of this book is a systematic treatment of the historic transformation
    of the West from monarchy to democracy. Revisionist in nature, it reaches the
    conclusion that monarchy is a lesser evil than democracy, but outlines deficiencies
    in both. Its methodology is axiomatic-deductive, allowing the writer to derive
    economic and sociological theorems, and then apply them to interpret historical
    events.\r\n\r\nA compelling chapter on time preference describes the progress
    of civilization as lowering time preferences as capital structure is built, and
    explains how the interaction between people can lower time all around, with interesting
    parallels to the Ricardian Law of Association. By focusing on this transformation,
    the author is able to interpret many historical phenomena, such as rising levels
    of crime, degeneration of standards of conduct and morality, and the growth of
    the mega-state. In underscoring the deficiencies of both monarchy and democracy,
    the author demonstrates how these systems are both inferior to a natural order
    based on private-property.\r\nHoppe deconstructs the classical liberal belief
    in the possibility of limited government and calls for an alignment of conservatism
    and libertarianism as natural allies with common goals. He defends the proper
    role of the production of defense as undertaken by insurance companies on a free
    market, and describes the emergence of private law among competing insurers. Having
    established a natural order as superior on utilitarian grounds, the author goes
    on to assess the prospects for achieving a natural order. Informed by his analysis
    of the deficiencies of social democracy, and armed with the social theory of legitimation,
    he forsees secession as the likely future of the US and Europe, resulting in a
    multitude of region and city-states. This book complements the author's previous
    work defending the ethics of private property and natural order. Democracy—The
    God that Failed will be of interest to scholars and students of history, political
    economy, and political philosophy. [amazon.com]"

  about: 'In the foreword to Human Action: A Treatise on Economics, Mises explains
    complex market phenomena as "the outcomes of countless conscious, purposive actions,
    choices, and preferences of individuals, each of whom was trying as best as he
    or she could under the circumstances to attain various wants and ends and to avoid
    undesired consequences." It is individual choices in response to personal subjective
    value judgments that ultimately determine market phenomena—supply and demand,
    prices, the pattern of production, and even profits and losses. Although governments
    may presume to set "prices," it is individuals who, by their actions and choices
    through competitive bidding for money, products, and services, actually determine
    "prices". Thus, Mises presents economics—not as a study of material goods, services,
    and products—but as a study of human actions. He sees the science of human action,
    praxeology, as a science of reason and logic, which recognizes a regularity in
    the sequence and interrelationships among market phenomena. Mises defends the
    methodology of praxeology against the criticisms of Marxists, socialists, positivists,
    and mathematical statisticians.Mises attributes the tremendous technological progress
    and the consequent increase in wealth and general welfare in the last two centuries
    to the introduction of liberal government policies based on free-market economic
    teachings, creating an economic and political environment which permits individuals
    to pursue their respective goals in freedom and peace. Mises also explains the
    futility and counter-productiveness of government attempts to regulate, control,
    and equalize all people''s circumstances: "Men are born unequal and ... it is
    precisely their inequality that generates social cooperation and civilization."Ludwig
    von Mises (1881–1973) was the leading spokesman of the Austrian School of Economics
    throughout most of the twentieth century. He earned his doctorate in law and economics
    from the University of Vienna in 1906. In 1926, Mises founded the Austrian Institute
    for Business Cycle Research. From 1909 to 1934, he was an economist for the Vienna
    Chamber of Commerce. Before the Anschluss, in 1934 Mises left for Geneva, where

  about: "The wisdom within these pages has the power to unlock our potential as a
    species and establish an enduring civilization based on peace, self-ownership,
    and nonviolence.\r\nYou, as a free, beautiful, independent human being with inalienable
    rights, own yourself! You can do what you want with your own body and the product
    of your labor. All human interactions should be free of force and coercion, and
    we are free to exercise our rights, limited only by respect for the rights of
    others. Governments rely on force, and force is a poor substitute for persuasion.
    When you learned \"don't hit,\" \"don't steal,\" and “don’t kill,” it wasn't,
    \"unless you work for the government.\" Governments frighten us into thinking
    we need them, but we are moving past the statist paradigm and rendering them obsolete.\r\nThis
    book will empower YOU to be more happy, free, and prosperous, while putting you
    in a position to help shape our destiny. [amazon.com]"

  title: For a New Liberty
  photo_url: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/For_A_New_Liberty.png/200px-For_A_New_Liberty.png
  about: 'A classic that for over two decades has been hailed as the best general
    work on libertarianism available. Rothbard begins with a quick overview of its
    historical roots, and then goes on to define libertarianism as resting "upon one
    single axiom: that no man or group of men shall aggress upon the person or property
    of anyone else." He writes a withering critique of the chief violator of liberty:
    the State. Rothbard then provides penetrating libertarian solutions for many of
    today''s most pressing problems, including poverty, war, threats to civil liberties,
    the education crisis, and more. [amazon.com]'

  title: Man, Economy and State
  photo_url: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Rothbard-MES.jpg/150px-Rothbard-MES.jpg
  about: "Murray N. Rothbard's great treatise Man, Economy, and State and its complementary
    text Power and Market, are here combined into a single edition as they were written
    to be. It provides a sweeping presentation of Austrian economic theory, a reconstruction
    of many aspects of that theory, a rigorous criticism of alternative schools, and
    an inspiring look at a science of liberty that concerns nearly everything and
    should concern everyone.\r\nThe Mises Institute's new edition of Man Economy,
    and State, united with its formerly sundered companion volume Power and Market,
    is a landmark in the history of the Institute. It takes this book out of the category
    of underground classic and raises it up to its proper status as one of the great
    economic treatises of all time, a book that is essential for anyone seeking a
    robust economic education.\r\nThis new edition will take your breath away with
    its beauty and quality. It's remarkable that a book this thick could lay so flat
    and be so durable with super-solid binding. It somehow turns out not to be unweildy.
    Get it with the Study Guide and you will have what you need.\r\nThe captivating
    new introduction by Professor Joseph Salerno that frames up the Rothbardian contribution
    in a completely new way, and reassesses the place of this book in the history
    of economic thought. In Salerno's view, Rothbard was not attempting to write a
    distinctively \"Austrian\" book but rather a comprehensive treatise on economics
    that eschewed the Keynesian and positivist corruptions. This is what accounts
    for its extraordinarily logical structure and depth. That it would later be called
    Austrian is only due to the long-lasting nature of the corruptions of economics
    that Rothbard tried to correct.\r\nFor years, the Mises Institute has kept it
    in print and sold thousands of copies in a nice paperback version. Then we decided
    to take a big step and put out an edition worthy of this great treatise. It is
    the Scholar's Edition of Man, Economy, and State -an edition that immediately
    became definitive and used throughout the world. The footnotes (which are so brilliant
    and informative!) are at the bottom of every page. The index is huge and comprehensive.
    The binding is impeccable and its beauty unmatched.\r\nStudents have used this
    book for decades as the intellectual foil for what they have been required to
    learning from conventional economics classes. In many ways, it has built the Austrian
    school in the generation that followed Mises. It was Rothbard who polished the
    Austrian contribution to theory and wove it together with a full-scale philosophy
    of political ethics that inspired the generation of the Austrian revival, and
    continues to fuel its growth and development today.\r\nFrom Rothbard, we learn
    that economics is the science that deals with the rise and fall of civilization,
    the advancement and retrenchment of human development, the feeding and healing
    of the multitudes, and the question of whether human affairs are dominated by
    cooperation or violence.\r\nEconomics in Rothbard's wonderful book emerges as
    the beautiful logic of that underlies human action in a world of scarcity, the
    lens on how exchange makes it possible for people to cooperate toward their mutual
    betterment. We see how money facilitates this, and allows for calculation over
    time that permits capital to expand and investment to take place. We see how entrepreneurship,
    based on real judgments and risk taking, is the driving force of the market.\r\nWhat's
    striking is how this remarkable book has lived in the shadows for so long. It
    began as a guide to Human Action, and it swelled into a treatise in its own right.

  title: Ethics of Liberty
  photo_url: http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KMR61Z60L.jpg
  about: "In recent years, libertarian impulses have increasingly influenced national
    and economic debates, from welfare reform to efforts to curtail affirmative action.
    Murray N. Rothbard's classic The Ethics of Liberty stands as one of the most rigorous
    and philosophically sophisticated expositions of the libertarian political position.\r\nWhat
    distinguishes Rothbard's book is the manner in which it roots the case for freedom
    in the concept of natural rights and applies it to a host of practical problems.
    An economist by profession, Rothbard here proves himself equally at home with
    philosophy. And while his conclusions are radical—that a social order that strictly
    adheres to the rights of private property must exclude the institutionalized violence
    inherent in the state—his applications of libertarian principles prove surprisingly
    practical for a host of social dilemmas, solutions to which have eluded alternative
    traditions.\r\nThe Ethics of Liberty authoritatively established the anarcho-capitalist
    economic system as the most viable and the only principled option for a social
    order based on freedom. This edition is newly indexed and includes a new introduction
    that takes special note of the Robert Nozick-Rothbard controversies. [amazon.com]"

  title: America's Great Depression
  photo_url: http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518Cq2OOZGL.jpg
  about: America's Great Depression is the classic treatise on the 1930s Great Depression
    and its root causes. Author Rothbard blames government interventionist policies
    for magnifying the duration, breadth, and intensity of the Great Depression. He
    explains how government manipulation of the money supply sets the stage for the
    familiar "boom-bust" phases of the modern market which we know all too well. He
    then details the inflationary policies of the Federal Reserve from 1921 to 1929
    as evidence that the depression was essentially caused not by speculation, but
    by government and central bank interference in the market. Clearly we find history
    tragically repeating itself today. A must-read. [amazon.com]
