    didn''t want to associate herself with anarchists. '

  about: known by his nom de plume Voltaire was a French Enlightenment writer, historian,
    and philosopher famous for his wit, his attacks on the established Catholic Church,
    and his advocacy of freedom of religion, freedom of expression, and separation
    of church and state. Voltaire was a versatile writer, producing works in almost
    every literary form, including plays, poems, novels, essays, and historical and
    scientific works. He wrote more than 20,000 letters and more than 2,000 books
    and pamphlets. He was an outspoken advocate, despite the risk this placed him
    in under the strict censorship laws of the time. As a satirical polemicist, he
    frequently made use of his works to criticize intolerance, religious dogma, and
    the French institutions of his day.

  full_name: Murray Newton Rothbard
  birth_date: '1926-03-02 00:00:00.000000'
  death_date: '1995-01-07 00:00:00.000000'
  about: "was an economist, scholar, intellectual and polymath who made major contributions
    in economics, political philosophy (libertarianism in particular), economic history
    and legal theory. He developed and extended the Austrian School of economics based
    on the earlier pioneering work of Ludwig von Mises. Rothbard eventually established
    himself as the principal Austrian theorist in the latter half of the twentieth
    century and applied Austrian analysis to historical topics such as the Great Depression
    of 1929 and the history of American banking.\r\n\r\nRothbard combined Austrian
    economics with a fervent commitment to individual liberty. He developed a unique
    synthesis that combined themes from nineteenth-century American individualist-anarchists
    such as Lysander Spooner and Benjamin Tucker with Austrian economics. A new political
    philosophy was the result, and Rothbard devoted his remarkable intellectual energy,
    over a period of some forty-five years, to developing and promoting his style
    of libertarianism. In doing so, he became a major American public intellectual.\r\n\r\nBuilding
    on the Austrian School's concept of spontaneous order, support for a free market
    in money production and condemnation of central planning, Rothbard advocated abolition
    of coercive government control of the economy. He considered the monopoly force
    of government the greatest danger to liberty and the long-term well-being of the
    populace, labeling the State as nothing but a \"a bandit gang writ large\"—the
    locus of the most immoral, grasping and unscrupulous individuals in any society."

  full_name: Ludwig Heinrich Edler von Mises
  birth_date: '1881-09-29 00:00:00.000000'
  death_date: '1973-10-10 00:00:00.000000'
  about: "was one of the most notable economists and social philosophers of the twentieth
    century. In the course of a long and highly productive life, he developed an integrated,
    deduct­ive science of economics based on the fundamental axiom that in­dividual
    human beings act purposively to achieve desired goals. Even though his economic
    analysis itself was \"value-free\" — in the sense of being irrelevant to values
    held by economists — Mises concluded that the only viable economic policy for
    the human race was a policy of unrestricted laissez-faire, of free markets and
    the unhampered exercise of the right of private property, with government strictly
    limited to the defense of person and property within its territorial area.\r\nFor
    Mises was able to demonstrate (a) that the expansion of free markets, the division
    of labor, and private capital investment is the only possible path to the prosperity
    and flourishing of the human race; (b) that socialism would be disastrous for
    a modern economy because the absence of private ownership of land and capital
    goods prevents any sort of rational pricing, or estimate of costs, and (c) that
    government intervention, in addition to hampering and crippling the market, would
    prove counter-productive and cumulative, leading inevitably to socialism unless
    the entire tissue of interventions was repealed.\r\nHolding these views, and hewing
    to truth indomitably in the face of a century increasingly devoted to statism
    and collectivism, Mises became famous for his \"intransigence\" in insisting on
    a non-inflationary gold standard and on laissez-faire."
